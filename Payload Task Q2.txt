Q: 
Access the model's ability to handle complex classfication tasks to uncover any limitations it may face in the real world scenarios
Ans:
Its real world problems are:-
#Its only used in linear systems, workd best for binary classification tasks
#If the decision boundary is highly non-linear, logistic regression might not be suitable.
#It is sensitive to values that are extremes(they can be errors perhPs)
#Quality and quantity of the dataset: real world data sets will have lesser quality(some values might be missing,
extreme values like mentioned before,etc). Real dtata sets may also larger and it will get difficult to code       it(explained in the next point)
#While I'm splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, here I am only evaluating the model's performance on a single test set. To ensure the model's generalization to unseen data, techniques like cross-validation or using multiple test sets might be necessary, especially in real-world scenarios where the data distribution might change over time. To implement this with larger data sets and with more that one sets will get difficult even to just program)


Note to reader: In the previous question, pixel binning, I'm aware that the output is not as intended and the image just looks more blur. I'm submitting it for now, for my own benefit, I will correct the code as soon as possible.
